# cats vs dogs classification problem using CNN 


This is a simple classification model to solve the problem of an input image is a cat or a dog using CNN.
The model consists of 4 convolutional layers each one followed by a max pooling layer and finally 2 fully connected layers.
The convolutional layers use a filter size 3 × 3 and pooling layer use 2 ×  2 which reduces the size to 1/2.
